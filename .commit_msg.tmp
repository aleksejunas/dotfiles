feat(theme): introduce new light/dark theme switching

This commit introduces a new system for switching between light and dark themes across the desktop environment.

A new script `toggle-dark-light-mode` has been added to handle theme changes for GTK, icons, and cursors. This is bound to `SUPER + U` in Hyprland.

The default theme has been changed from Dracula to a combination of `adw-gtk3-dark` and `Sunrise`.

refactor(nvim): update plugins and improve configuration

- Updated numerous plugins to their latest versions.
- Added support for `copilot` and `codex`.
- Removed the `darcubox` theme in favor of a more centralized theme management approach.
- Added an autocommand to save files automatically when focus is lost.
